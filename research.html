<p><small>If this were a map<br>
it would be the map of the last age of her life,<br>
not a map of choices but a map of variations<br>
on the one great choice. It would be the map by which<br>
she could see the end of touristic choices,<br>
of distances blued and purpled by romance,<br>
by which she would recognize that poetry<br>
isn’t revolution but a way of knowing<br>
why it must come.<br>

        <h1>Research</h1>
          <p>My current book project investigates the relationship between literary form, aesthetic feeling, and the experience of history in twentieth-century novel series by Ford Madox Ford, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, Lawrence Durrell, and Kazuo Ishiguro (whose 1995 novel The Unconsoled serves as a limit case of seriality). It is situated at the intersection of new formalist approaches in literary studies (Marshall Brown, Thomas S. Davis, Caroline Levine, Susan Wolfson et al.) and affect theories (Jonathan Flatley, Sianne Ngai, Julie Taylor, et al.). I look at how formal orientations, rhythms, and other dynamics transmit historical and collective moods (e.g., anxiety, suffocation, disorientation, and exhaustion) in the twentieth century. Another integral part of my project is reformulating a theory of experimental novel series by showing how this form retains a maximal tension between temporal fragmentation and linearity, chance and telos. </p>
          <p>I also plan on starting my second book project, which focuses on interwar British fiction and energy infrastructure. Bringing together current scholarship on energy humanities and the critical (re)turn to the politics of literary forms, this project examines how the literary affects of asphyxia, suffocation, contamination, and other violent modes of respiration in interwar English and Scottish fiction transmit the latent violence of coal, kerosene, and petroleum infrastructure in everyday life. It features chapters on Lettice Cooper, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, Virginia Woolf, and Patrick Hamilton, and aims to demonstrate that these writers’ use of syntax, rhythms, and tropes evokes violent respiratory experiences as a critique of carbon capitalism. </p>
