<p><small>If this were a map<br>
it would be the map of the last age of her life,<br>
not a map of choices but a map of variations<br>
on the one great choice. It would be the map by which<br>
she could see the end of touristic choices,<br>
of distances blued and purpled by romance,<br>
by which she would recognize that poetry<br>
isnâ€™t revolution but a way of knowing<br>
why it must come.<br>
--- from Adrienne Rich, "Dreamwood"<small>

        <h1>Studies in Modernism</h1>
        <p>This course will introduce modernism as a set of aesthetic and cultural movements that responded to tremendous social changes and political tumults in the first half of the twentieth century. We will survey some major contributions to modernist fiction and poetry by British, American, and Canadian artists. We will focus on developments in narrative and technique, critical statements by modernist artists, and the cultural contexts that gave rise to them. We will also situate modernism in relation to nineteenth-century realism and postmodernism. The focus will be on several key figures, striving for a balance between male and female, and straight and queer, artists. Questions of empire, colonialism, emergent global capitalism, sex and sexuality, subjectivity, gender, war and violence, race and racism, nationhood, and cosmopolitanism will feature prominently. </p>
