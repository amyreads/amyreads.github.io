<p><small>If this were a map<br>
it would be the map of the last age of her life,<br>
not a map of choices but a map of variations<br>
on the one great choice. It would be the map by which<br>
she could see the end of touristic choices,<br>
of distances blued and purpled by romance,<br>
by which she would recognize that poetry<br>
isnâ€™t revolution but a way of knowing<br>
why it must come.<br>
--- from Adrienne Rich, "Dreamwood"<small>
