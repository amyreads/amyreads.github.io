<p><small>If this were a map<br>
it would be the map of the last age of her life,<br>
not a map of choices but a map of variations<br>
on the one great choice. It would be the map by which<br>
she could see the end of touristic choices,<br>
of distances blued and purpled by romance,<br>
by which she would recognize that poetry<br>
isn’t revolution but a way of knowing<br>
why it must come.<br>
--- from Adrienne Rich, "Dreamwood"<small>

      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p><img src="img/propic2.JPG" width=210px height=280px /></p>
      
      
  <p>I am Assistant Professor of English at the University of the Fraser Valley in Abbotsford BC, which is situated on the unceded traditional territories of the Stó:lō people. I specialize in C20/21 British and Irish literature, modernism, critical theory, and the environmental humanities. At UFV, I regularly teach English courses ranging from C20/21 British and Irish lit to academic writing. Working with students and creating learning communities are always the highlights of my job! 
  <p>In 2013, I moved from my hometown Jiaxing (Zhejiang Prov., China) to Victoria (BC, Canada), the latter of which is located on the unceded traditional territories of the Lekwungen and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples. I got both my MA and PhD at the University of Victoria, and I felt lucky to be able to spend a few years in that beautiful city. Beyond academia, I do a lot of drawing (illustrations and oil painting) and cooking. Recently I started to learn baking: so far, I made blueberry muffins, cheesecake, and two very flat loaves of banana bread...</p>
